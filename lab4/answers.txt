# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We forked a new process for each download or upload task.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

We fixed filename transfer by setting the strcpy to strncpy, this let me define the size of transfer.
Then we set the last character to the null byte to prevent buffer overrun.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We added a MAXFILESIZ to 45000, which is slightly bigger than cat1.jpg, cat2.jpg and cat3.jpg. Whenever the total_written is greater than equal to MAXFILESIZ, we tell the task to tryagain.
We changed the TASKBUFSIZ to fix the run-popular bug of "tracker connection closed prematurely!".

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
